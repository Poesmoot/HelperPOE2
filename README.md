# HelperPOE2
Helper is an overlay created from scratch for league start scenario. It's not created to replace existing overlays (e.g. ExileCore). Basically, every league it takes few hours to few days to fully update ExileCore and that's not good for anyone. Developers who are working on updating the overlay misses the league start economy advantage. Users, who are waiting for the overlay, have a wait until someone fixes the overlay. At-least, that's what I have felt in the past, it may be different for different people.
